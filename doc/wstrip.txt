INTRO                                                            *wstrip-intro*

This plugin uses `git-diff` to strip whitespace from lines that you changed
or added while editing.  This allows you to keep newly added or changed lines
free of trailing whitespace without affecting the history of existing lines.

If the file is not in a `git` repository, `diff` is used to make a simple
comparison against the existing file on disk. The same commands, configuration
settings and functionality apply.


==============================================================================
INSTALLATION						      *wstrip-install*

Place the wstrip.vim/ plugin project directory anywhere in your filesystem. A 
reasonable location would be `~/.vim/wstrip.vim/`. To function correcty the
plugin project must be on the vim `runtimepath`. The current `runtimepath` can
be examined with `:set rtp`. Put a line such as this containg the plugin path
in your `vimrc` (not `gvimrc`) to add the plugin path at the front of
`runtimepath`:

`execute "set rtp=~/.vim/wstrip.vim".&rtp`

and restart vim. You can run `:scriptnames` to verify wstrip.vim plugin is
loaded.

To enable `:help wstrip` it is necessary to run a one-time build of help 
tags for the plugin by doing this command (again, with your chosen path to
wstrip.vim).

`:helptags ~/.vim/wstrip.vim/doc`

Another way to install the plugin is to use a plugin manager such as
"pathogen" (which is also a vim plugin). It automatically sets the
`runtimepath` and provides a simplied `:Helptags` command while making it
easier to install and manage several different plugins, typically under
~/.vim/bundle/. Pathogen and other plugin managers are available on github.
If a plugin manager is used, follow the installation instructions provided.


==============================================================================
COMMAND                                                       *wstrip-command*

								    *:WStrip*
:WStrip				Strip trailing whitespace only on new and
				changed lines in the buffer. `:w` must still
			        be done before the file is updated.
				This is the same action that occurs before a
				`:w` (save) when wstrip_auto is set to `1`.

								*:WStrip_all*
:WStrip all			Strip trailing whitespace on ALL lines in
				buffer. `:w` (save) must still be done before
			       	the file is updated. This never occurs
				automatically.

								  *:WStrip_show*
:WStrip show			Show highlighting for all trailing whitespace.
				Even if configuration value g:wstrip_highlight
				is 0, this shows highlighting.

								  *:WStrip_hide*
:WStrip hide			Hide highlighting for all trailing whitespace
				even if g:wstrip_highlight is non-zero.


==============================================================================
CONFIG                                                          *wstrip-config*

							       *g:wstrip_auto*
g:wstrip_auto			Enables automatic cleaning of trailing
				whitespace when a buffer is saved. Same action
				as `WStrip` command.

				Note: `b:wstrip_auto` can be used to enable
				this option per-buffer.

				Default: `0` (no automatic whitespace removal)

							  *g:wstrip_highlight*
g:wstrip_highlight		Enables highlighting of trailing whitespace.
				The `WStripTrailing` syntax group is used for
				highlighting. When set non-zero, highlighting
				immediately occurs when file is first edited.
				Setting this to zero while editing does not
				remove highlighting. Use command `Wstrip hide`
				to do that.

				Note: If Vim determines it can display under-
				lined text, the trailing whitespace will be
				highlighted with a red underline.  Otherwise,
				the trailing whitespace will be highlighted
				with a red background.

				Note: `b:wstrip_highlight` can be used to
				enable this option per-buffer.

				Default: `1` (highlighting enabled)

						       *b:wstrip_trailing_max*
b:wstrip_trailing_max		The maximum amount of trailing whitespace
				that is left after any additional  
				whitespace is stripped. E.g., If have 6 
				trailing whitespaces; if b:wstrip_trailing_max
				is 4, after stripping, 4 whitespaces remain.
				However, if there are initially 4 or less
				trailing whitespaces, none will be stripped.
				
				Note: If highlighting is enabled, only the
				whitespace that would be stripped is highlighted.

				Note: This defaults to `2` for the `markdown`
				|filetype| if b:wstrip_trailing_max is not
				set. For other |filetype|s it defaults to 0.
				If the special settings for markdown file 
				editing is not needed, just remove wstrip file
			        `/wstrip.vim/ftplugin/markdown.vim`.

				Default: `0` (leave no trailing whitespace
				on stripped lines)
