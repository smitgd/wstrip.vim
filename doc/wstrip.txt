INTRO                                                            *wstrip-intro*

This plugin uses `git-diff` to strip whitespace from lines that you changed
or added while editing.  This allows you to keep newly added or changed lines
free of trailing whitespace without affecting the history of existing lines.

If the file is not in a `git` repository, `diff` is used to make a simple
comparison against the existing file on disk. The same commands and
configuration settings apply.


==============================================================================
COMMAND                                                       *wstrip-command*

								    *:WStrip*
:WStrip				Strip trailing whitespace only on new and
				changed lines in the buffer. `:w` must still
			        be done before the file is updated.
				This is the same action that occurs before a
				`:w` (save) when wstrip_auto is set to `1`.

								*:WStrip_all*
:WStrip all			Strip trailing whitespace on ALL lines in
				buffer. `:w` (save) must still be done before
			       	the file is updated. This never occurs
				automatically.

								  *:WStrip_show*
:WStrip show			Show highlighting for all trailing whitespace.
				Even if configuration value g:wstrip_highlight
				is 0, this shows highlighting.

								  *:WStrip_hide*
:WStrip hide			Hide highlighting for all trailing whitespace
				even if g:wstrip_highlight is non-zero.


==============================================================================
CONFIG                                                          *wstrip-config*

							       *g:wstrip_auto*
g:wstrip_auto			Enables automatic cleaning of trailing
				whitespace when a buffer is saved. Same action
				as `WStrip` command.

				Note: `b:wstrip_auto` can be used to enable
				this option per-buffer.

				Default: `0` (no automatic whitespace removal)

							  *g:wstrip_highlight*
g:wstrip_highlight		Enables highlighting of trailing whitespace.
				The `WStripTrailing` syntax group is used for
				highlighting. When set non-zero, highlighting
				immediately occurs when file is first edited.
				Setting this to zero while editing does not
				remove highlighting. Use command `Wstrip hide`
				to do that.

				Note: If Vim determines it can display under-
				lined text, the trailing whitespace will be
				highlighted with a red underline.  Otherwise,
				the trailing whitespace will be highlighted
				with a red background.

				Note: `b:wstrip_highlight` can be used to
				enable this option per-buffer.

				Default: `1` (highlighting enabled)

						       *b:wstrip_trailing_max*
b:wstrip_trailing_max		The maximum amount of trailing whitespace that
				can exist before the remaining whitespace is
				stripped.

				Note: If highlighting is enabled, only the
				excess whitespace is highlighted.

				Note: This is set to `2` for the `markdown`
				|filetype| if b:wstrip_trailing_max is not
				set. For other |filetype|s it defaults to 0.

				Note: If `2` spaces remain after cleaning even
				though b:wstrip_trailing_max is set to
				something else, it is because wstrip file
				ftplugin/markdown.vim is in the wrong place.
				It must not be under toplevel plugin directory
				but under toplevel ftplugin directory, e.g.,
				`mkdir -p ~/.vim/ftplugin`
				`cd ~/.vim`
				`mv plugin/wstrip.vim/ftplugin/markdown.vim \`
				`ftplugin/`
				Alternatively, if special settings for
				markdown file editing are not needed, just
				remove wstrip file `ftplugin/markdown.vim`.

				Default: `0` (leave no trailing whitespace
				on stripped lines)
